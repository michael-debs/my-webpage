# git and github

## git commands 

1. checkout switch between branches + -b for creating one 
2. commit changes + -m for writing a message 
3. git diff to see the changes in the code + name of the branch 
4. git push to save commits on github + -u (so we can set the default branch for pushing commits) + origin + name of the branch (we can push the branch itself if it was created locally)
5. git pull we use it so we can merge code from a branch to the base branch (git merge = git push + git pull) || git pull from the base branch to show github changes after a merge or a modification 
2. git branch to show branches / -d to delete
